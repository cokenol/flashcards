Configure an IP-based domain access policy on Amazon ES. Add an allow statement to the policy that includes the private IP CIDR blocks from each branch office network.	C. Deploy a new Amazon ES domain in private subnets in a VPC, and import a snapshot from the old domain. Create a security group that allows inbound traffic from the branch office CIDR blocks.	D. Reconfigure the Amazon ES domain in private subnets in a VPC. Create a security group that allows inbound traffic from the branch office CIDR blocks. 	B
88. A large company is using AWS Organizations to manage its multi-account AWS environment. According to company policy, all users should have read-level access to a particular Amazon S3 bucket in a central account. The S3 bucket data should not be available outside the organization. A SysOps administrator must set up the permissions and add a bucket policy to the S3 bucket. Which parameters should be specified to accomplish this in the MOST efficient manner? 	A. Specify '*' as the principal and PrincipalOrgld as a condition.	B. Specify all account numbers as the principal.	C. Specify PrincipalOrgld as the principal.	D. Specify the organization's management account as the principal.	C
89. A SysOps administrator is troubleshooting connection timeouts to an Amazon EC2 instance that has a public IP address. The instance has a private IP address of 172.31.16.139. When the SysOps administrator tries to ping the instance's public IP address from the remote IP address 203.0.113.12, the response is "request timed out." The flow logs contain the following information: What is one cause of the problem? <img src="./images/Q89.png" style="max-width:500px;"><br />	A. Inbound security group deny rule	B. Outbound security group deny rule	C. Network ACL inbound rules	D. Network ACL outbound rules 	D
90. A company has multiple Amazon EC2 instances that run a resource-intensive application in a development environment. A SysOps administrator is implementing a solution to stop these EC2 instances when they are not in use. Which solution will meet this requirement? 	A. Assess AWS CloudTrail logs to verify that there is no EC2 API activity. Invoke an AWS Lambda function to stop the EC2 instances.	B. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to stop the EC2 instances when the average CPU utilization is lower than 5% for a 30-minute period.	C. Create an Amazon CloudWatch metric to stop the EC2 instances when the VolumeReadBytes metric is lower than 500 for a 30-minute period	D. Use AWS Config to invoke an AWS Lambda function to stop the EC2 instances based on resource configuration changes.	B
91. A SysOps administrator needs to configure a solution that will deliver digital content to a set of authorized users through Amazon CloudFront. Unauthorized users must be restricted from access. Which solution will meet these requirements? 	A. Store the digital content in an Amazon S3 bucket that does not have public access blocked. Use signed URLs to access the S3 bucket through CloudFront.
